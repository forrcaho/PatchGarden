/**
 * A SoundFont made here: one preset, one instrument, one looping sine.
 *
 * The app shipped GeneralUser GS until 2026-09-19 and these tests loaded it out of the
 * assets; it is the user's to install now, so the tests carry their own bank instead. A
 * made one is better for them anyway: 250Hz exactly (192 samples at 48kHz, so the loop is
 * seamless) at key 60, where a real bank's presets are each tuned however their sampler
 * felt -- GeneralUser's piano is 12 cents sharp at C5 and its organs sound an octave down.
 * What these tests measure is the node's tuning, so the bank's own must be exact.
 *
 * Little-endian, as SF2 is and as every machine this builds on is.
