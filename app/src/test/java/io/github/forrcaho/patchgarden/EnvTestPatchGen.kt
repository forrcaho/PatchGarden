/**
 * Writes a patch for listening to the segment envelope, built through the model so the file
 * is one the app would have written itself.
 *
 * Throwaway, like [EarTestPatchGen]: a generator, not a test of anything. It is a test only
 * because the model lives in the app module and that is the cheapest way to run against it.
 *
 * Seq -> Osc -> Gain -> Out, with the same Seq opening an Env on the Gain's modulation port,
 * so what you hear is the envelope's shape and nothing else -- an Osc is one knob and the
 * Gain has no character of its own. The dots are long and well separated, because the point
 * is to hear a whole shape rather than a texture.
