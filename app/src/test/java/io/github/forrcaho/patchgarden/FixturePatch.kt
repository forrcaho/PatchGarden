/**
 * A complete small instrument, for the tests that want a real patch to work on: Steps sends
 * notes into a poly subpatch called Voice -- an Osc, an Env and the Gain it opens, stamped out
 * four times by the engine -- whose sum goes through a Filter to both outputs.
 *
 * It was the patch a fresh install opened with until 2026-09-23, when the app started opening
 * on an empty canvas instead: it began with Steps, which the Add menu no longer offers, left
 * the Filter outside the Voice where it could track nothing, and did not fit a phone's screen.
 * As a fixture none of that matters, and fifty tests already know its shape.
