/**
 * Gain's `mod` port is its gain's own jack: one way in, where there were two.
 *
 * Until format 15 the port multiplied the knob and the knob could be exposed as well, so the
 * same envelope patched into both was applied twice -- `in * env * (0.6 + 0.8 * env)`, found
 * in the phone's own patch. Now the gain is a driven knob ([Param.drivenBy]): plain while the
 * port is empty, bracketed while it is patched, and never exposable.
