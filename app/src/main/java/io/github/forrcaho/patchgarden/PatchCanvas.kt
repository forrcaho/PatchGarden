/*
 * A touch-first patch canvas.
 *
 * Three departures from the ModSynth/Bespoke drag-a-cable model:
 *
 *  1. Connections are made by TAPPING an output, then TAPPING an input. No sustained
 *     drag across the screen, no finger covering the thing you're aiming at. Tapping
 *     empty space or the same port again cancels.
 *
 *  2. Hit targets are measured in SCREEN space, not world space. ModSynth divides the
 *     touch point by its zoom factor before testing, so ports get physically smaller as
 *     you zoom out — which is why it just disables connecting below 0.75 zoom. Here the
 *     target is a fixed amount of glass, so patching works zoomed out.
 *
 *  3. One unified gesture loop rather than competing detectors. Compose's
 *     detectTransformGestures / detectDragGestures / detectTapGestures all consume
 *     events, so stacking them fights over the same pointer. awaitEachGesture lets us
 *     decide once, on the first move, what this gesture actually is.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * UNITS. World units are DP. This is load-bearing, and it used to be wrong: module
 * geometry was raw floats handed to DrawScope, which draws in PIXELS, while the touch
 * radius went through Dp.toPx(). The two only agreed at density 1.0 — which is where
 * @Preview renders, and nowhere else. On the reference device (density 2.4375) a module
 * came out 47.6x34.5dp with its ports 17.2dp apart inside a 24dp hit radius, so which
 * port you got was close to a coin flip.
 *
 * Everything below is therefore in dp, and Camera.worldToScreen folds density into the
 * one place that converts.
 *
 * TWO SPACES. Free modules live in world space and move with the camera. The I/O rails
 * are PINNED to the viewport edges and live in screen space, so they keep a constant
 * size and stay reachable at any zoom. Cables can therefore have one endpoint in each
 * space, which is why every cable is drawn in screen space after resolving both ends —
 * see portScreen(). The screen-space hit test needed no changes to cope with this,
 * which is a point in favor of thesis #2.

     * `ModuleColorTest` pins the rule: the cable color nearest each accent is the kind

     * borders on screen with each accent still clearly nearest its own cable.

     * There was no scheme before -- the accents were accidents of when each module was
     * added. Env was exactly the modulation cable's purple, Filter exactly the old gate's
     * orange, and Osc one shade off the note cable's green, so some colors meant "sends
