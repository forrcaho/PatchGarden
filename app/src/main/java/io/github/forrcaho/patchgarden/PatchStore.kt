/*
 * Patch persistence.
 *
 * Hand-rolled against org.json rather than kotlinx.serialization. The schema is four
 * fields per entity, and a file on disk is untrusted input that needs validating either
 * way -- a stale patch naming a module type that no longer exists, or a connection whose
 * port index has moved, must load as "ignore that entry", never as a crash on launch.
 * With the validation written regardless, the plugin and dependency would buy nothing.
 *
 * Only free modules are stored. The rails are recreated by Patch's constructor and are
 * referenced by their reserved ids, so their cables survive a reload without their
 * geometry being persisted.

/**
 * 2: the Clock module became the patch's tempo. 3: one scale became a list of them.
 * 4: parameters can be exposed for modulation, and cables can land on them.
 * 5: CV and gate retired, taking the monophonic Osc and the VCA with them.
 * 6: subpatches. Additive -- a format 5 file is a patch with no subpatches -- so 5 still reads.
 * 9: the redesign around subpatches. Groups became subpatches, so their type names in the
 * file changed; Osc and FM lost their envelopes, so their knob lists are shorter and every
 * index after the first moved; Poly and Amp arrived. Nothing older can be read.
 * 10: a note's length is in quarter steps, and Seq lost its gate knob. A 9 reads as a
 * quarter of the music it is.
 * 11: a note says how hard it is struck. Additive, and a 10 still reads: a note without a
 * velocity comes back at full, which is what every note in the app sounded at.
 * 12: a Filter says its type and its slope. Additive in the same way -- a filter that names
 * neither was a 12dB lowpass, which is what it comes back as -- so 11 and 10 still read.
 * The bump is for the other direction: knobs are keyed by name, so an 11 build would read
 * a bandpass, ignore the two knobs it does not know, and autosave it as a lowpass.
 * 13: a Filter takes notes and tracks them. Additive again -- no track knob is no tracking,
 * and a port appended leaves every saved cable's index where it was. The bump is for the
 * older build, which would read a cable into a port it does not have, skip it quietly, and
 * autosave the patch without it.
 * 14: an Env is segments, and **14 reads nothing but 14**. The additive run ends here. An
 * envelope's four knobs are gone and what replaced them is not a renaming of them: A, D and
 * R were one-pole *time constants* toward targets they never reach, where a segment runs a
 * stated distance in a stated time. The mapping exists -- a release from sustain S really
 * lasts R*ln(1 + 100S), which is about four times the knob -- and using it would be a
 * conversion and not a restatement, which is exactly the line 10 was drawn on. An ADSR read
 * as four segments with the wrong curvature is a patch that loads, plays, and is not the
 * sound that was saved.
 * 15: Amp's `mod` port is its gain's own jack, sweeping it between brackets, and the gain
 * can no longer be exposed. 15 reads nothing but 15 as well: a 14 Amp whose gain was exposed
 * and patched had two modulators on one number, which nothing in 15 can say. Forrest's call,
 * with no patch worth keeping during development -- going clean was cheaper than a refusal
 * that looks inside the file.
 * 16: an Osc has a tune knob, and Noise, Delay and Reverb arrived. Additive, so 15 still
 * reads: an Osc that names no tune was in tune, which is what it comes back as, and a 15
 * file names none of the new modules. The bump is for the older build, which would ignore a
 * tune it does not know and read the new modules as retired, then autosave without either.
 * All four landed in one night with no build installed between them, so they share it.
 * 17: an interval can be any number of steps to a beat, or of beats to a step, and an LFO
 * has one. Additive, so 16 and 15 still read: the table the interval knob indexes only grew
 * -- its first nine entries and "free" at 9 kept their places -- and an LFO that names no
 * interval was free, which is what it comes back as. The bump is for the older build, which
 * would clamp five to a beat onto a sixteenth-note triplet and ignore a synced LFO's interval,
 * then autosave both as though that were what had been written.
 * 18: an interval says its beats and its divisions outright -- 64 + (beats - 1) * 16 +
 * (divisions - 1) -- where it was an index into the table 17 grew. Additive all the same, so
 * 17, 16 and 15 still read: the table is still how every value under 64 is read, and every
 * entry in it is exactly some beats divided into some divisions. Nothing is converted; the
 * old values are simply still understood. The bump is for the older build, which would clamp
 * any value past its table to sixteen beats a step.
 * 19: every synth and Noise has a level with its own jack, Amp is Gain, and the interval
 * knob's codes start at 1 with free at 0, the table under them gone. **19 reads nothing but
 * 19**, and not because nothing could have been restated: until development settles,
 * compatibility is dropped wherever dropping it is an option (Forrest, 2026-10-02; see
 * CLAUDE.md). Keeping 15 to 18 readable would have meant an "Amp" alias, a level port
 * appended where it could be read past, and the interval table kept for values nobody writes.
 * 20: the interval knob's beats and divisions each run to 1023 where they stopped at 16, with a
 * radix of 1024, and a step can be said in bars, from a code of its own; a Delay and an LFO
 * have a `period` knob saying how their fixed time is shown. Reads nothing but 20, under the
 * same policy: a 19 code read with the new radix is a different step, and that is a refusal,
 * never a conversion.
 * 21: the overnight build of 2026-10-04 -- an LFO has a phase, and ModSeq, a loop of levels
 * sent as modulation, is a new module whose levels are saved as `levels`; a Seq has versions,
 * each note saying which as a fifth number, with `version` and `versions` knobs; and an Osc
 * has its `fm` port back, a third input, with an `index` knob. Reads nothing but 21, under
 * the same policy, one bump for everything that night.
 * 22: the Arranger, roadmap item 5, a new module whose scenes are saved as `scenes` -- a name
 * and a level a lane -- and whose songs as `songs`, a list each of [scene, steps]. Reads nothing
 * but 22, under the same policy: an older build would read it as retired and autosave without it.
 * 23: the Seq reworked, 2026-10-09 -- its notes saved as `notes` where they were `dots`, a note's
 * length in whole steps, the sequence's length in beats or bars, and per-version notes. Reads
 * nothing but 23: a 22 file read here would lose every note without a word.
