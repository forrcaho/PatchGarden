/*
 * SoundFonts: the ones the user puts in `soundfonts`, beside the scales and the subpatches.
 *
 * None ship with the app. GeneralUser GS was bundled for a day and taken out on 2026-09-19:
 * it is 32MB of the download for a file anyone who wants an SF module can fetch themselves,
 * and the README says where. So an SF module starts with no bank and asks for one.
 *
 * A font is loaded once, on a background thread -- parsing a bank converts every sample to
 * float, which for a large one is seconds on a phone -- and kept for the life of the
 * process. Every SF module playing it gets its own synth over the one copy of the samples,
 * built natively when GraphSync hands the module its font.
