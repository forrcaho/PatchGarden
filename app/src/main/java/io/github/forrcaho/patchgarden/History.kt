/**
 * Undo, as a stack of whole patches.
 *
 * Snapshots rather than inverted commands. A patch serializes to a few kilobytes of the
 * JSON we already produce, so fifty of them cost nothing -- and there are no inverses to
 * get wrong. The command approach needs every mutation to have a correct opposite, and
 * the one you forget is a silent corruption rather than a crash.
 *
 * Settled states only. Fed from the same debounce as autosave, a continuous knob drag
 * arrives as one entry instead of three hundred.

/**
 * Makes this patch look like [source], in place.
 *
 * In place because the patch is referenced by the composition, the autosave and the graph
 * sync; swapping the object would leave all three pointing at the old one. The rails are
 * kept and only their knobs copied, since a snapshot does not describe their geometry.
 *
 * All of it inside one mutable snapshot, which is not a tidiness point. Applied
 * piecemeal, the observer behind `GraphSync` can see the moment after the cables are
 * cleared and before they are restored -- and an empty patch is a real state to the
 * engine, which would dutifully crossfade every voice to silence and back. Undo would
 * click. One atomic apply means the diff only ever sees before and after.
 *
 * Which panel is open is carried across by id. Undo changes the document, not the view:
 * the camera does not move, and neither should the thing you are looking at. Free
 * modules are rebuilt as new objects here, so without this an undo from inside a panel
 * would slam it shut -- which is the one moment you most want to watch, since the knob
 * you just moved is on screen and about to move back.
