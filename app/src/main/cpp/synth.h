 * Env's job now, inside a poly subpatch where there is one Env per note -- an envelope
 * built into a synth can only be the same envelope for every voice, which is what made
 * "patch an Env to FM's index" impossible and started the redesign. What a synth still
 * owes is not sounding a step when a gate opens or closes, and that is this.
 *
 * Five milliseconds, smoothstepped so the slope is zero at both ends as well as the value
 * -- the same reason the graph's crossfades are smoothstepped rather than linear. Long
 * enough that the edge is not broadband, short enough that a staccato sixteenth still
 * sounds staccato. It is not 30ms like a crossfade because a crossfade happens under a
 * note you are already playing and this *is* the note starting.
 *
 * **The level belongs in here with the gate**, which velocity taught the hard way. A voice
 * used to take its velocity as an oscillator amplitude, set outright at the strike -- fine
 * for a note that starts from silence, and a hard step for one that takes a voice already
 * sounding. Two notes that abut, or a steal, then jumped the waveform by the whole
 * difference between the two velocities: at 0.4 against 1.0 that is a step of 0.22 where
 * the waveform's own largest is 0.014. Heard on the phone as clicking between notes, and
 * gone when every note was at full -- which is the tell, since equal velocities have no
 * difference to step. A gate that ramps and a level that does not is not a declicked voice.

 * Notes in, sound out: one note at a time, and everything a synth does that is not the
 * sound itself.
 *
 * Every synth here is monophonic, which is the point of the poly subpatch rather than a
 * limitation beside it. Polyphony used to live inside each synth -- eight voices, one
 * envelope shared between them, nothing per note reachable from outside -- and that is the
 * thing the redesign replaced. A voice is a patch now: an Osc, an Env on its level and whatever
 * else, inside a Poly the engine stamps out per note. Leaving eight voices in here as well
 * would be two allocators stacked on one another, the inner one never choosing anything,
 * and the whole design surface it was meant to retire still present.
 *
 * What is left is what one note needs and PolyIn does not do: resolving a degree to a pitch
 * against the scale of its beat, matching an Off to its On by source as well as id, gliding
 * on a Change, and releasing when the source is unpatched. Each of those was paid for by a
 * bug found on the phone, which is why they are here once rather than in each synth.
 *
 * A Voice provides:
 *
 *   void  init(float sampleRate)
 *   void  strike(float hz, float velocity, bool stolen)  // a note starts
 *   void  setFreq(float hz)                              // a glide moved it
 *   float render(bool gate, bool &finished)              // one sample
 *
 * render() sets [finished] once the voice has nothing left to say -- its gate ramp has run
 * out, or a plucked string has rung out -- and it is free from then on. Which of those it is
 * is the voice's business, because only it knows what its silence looks like.
 *
 * **Every synth has a level, and the level has a jack** (port 1, driving the knob the
 * subclass names -- see Node::drivenParam). With nothing patched it is a knob. With an Env
 * patched it is how the note is shaped, and then the note *outlives its Off*: the gate stays
 * open for as long as that envelope runs, so its release is heard rather than cut off by a
 * gate closing underneath it. That was the whole cost of taking the envelopes out of the
 * synths -- an Env's release was silent unless what it opened was a gain after the synth --
 * and this is the Bespoke answer to it without putting an ADSR back. With anything else
 * patched, or nothing, a note still stops at its Off.
 *
 * A template rather than a virtual call, since render() runs once per sample.
