 * accumulates no rounding: a tempo change re-anchors at the current beat, and everything
 * after it is one multiplication from the anchor.
 *
 * Two Clock nodes could drift apart, because each truncated its own period to whole
 * frames -- 127bpm is 22677.17 frames a beat, and a module losing 0.17 of a frame every
 * beat is a sixth of a second out after twenty minutes. Every division here is computed
 * from the same position, so there is nothing to drift.
