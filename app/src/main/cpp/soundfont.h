/**
 * A SoundFont player: notes in, sound out.
 *
 * Not a MonoSynth, because TinySoundFont has voices of its own and renders them all at
 * once. What this adds is the engine's idea of pitch. A SoundFont thinks in MIDI keys; a
 * note here is a degree of whatever scale is sounding. So each note gets a channel of its
 * own, is played on the nearest key, and the channel's tuning -- fractional semitones --
 * carries the rest. A 19-TET degree lands where it should, and a Change glides the channel.
 *
 * Silent until its synth arrives: the font loads in the background, and the node exists
 * from the moment the module does. It keeps count of its notes all the same, and strikes
 * whatever is held when a synth arrives -- found on the emulator, where a drone's chord,
 * sent in the same sync that made the node, reached it a quarter of a second before its
 * font and was never heard. Changing font re-strikes the chord the same way.
 *
 * Knobs, mirroring PatchCanvas.kt: preset (bank * 128 + program, chosen from the panel's
 * header) and level, which its second port drives as every sound source's does. Unlike a
 * MonoSynth's, an envelope there holds no note open: a SoundFont's notes have releases of
 * their own, and this one's are TinySoundFont's to sound.
