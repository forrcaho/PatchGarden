 * Phase 3 builds a graph bridge on the assumption that it does. `aaudio.mmap_policy`
 * reporting AUTO means permitted, not granted.

 * The callback is already written to the rules the bridge will need: no allocation, no
 * locks, no JNI into the JVM. Phase 3 replaces the body, not the discipline.
